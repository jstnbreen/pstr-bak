			Pilgrim Sands Trail Riders was established in 1974 as a non-profit organization dedicated to the sport of off-road motorcycling. PSTR is affiliated with the New England Trail Rider Association (NETRA) and the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA). We have nearly 300 members, and put on several events each year including hare scrambles, enduros, and recreational rides. PSTR also leads in preserving our right to ride by attending land use meetings, collaborating with land managing agencies, and maintaining relationships with private landowners. The proceeds from our events benefit the local communities we ride in.
