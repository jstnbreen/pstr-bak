		<!--<p>
			The PSTR competition committee has made some changes to the class structure for the 2015 Short Course Series. Because of this change, some riders may have to be issued a new number. Check out the “Short Course Series Info” page to see if you were effected.
		</p>
		<p>
			In an effort to keep the sign up process as efficient as possible, you will be able to request a new number in advance. Also if you are ne…w to our series this is your opportunity to get a number now.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please print the form below and mail it back to the address on the application. I will do my best to mail them back to you, provided the pre-printed numbers are available in a timely manner. If not the scoring packet will be at the first short course.
		</p>
		<p>
			I know a lot of people will want to know their numbers ASAP. Once the scoring team has issued you a number I will be able to tell you what it is, so you don’t have to wait for the packet in the mail.

		<h4>What do I do if I want to change classes?</h4>
		<p>
			A new number is $20 and we reprogram the transponder with your new number for free.
		</p>

		<h4>Where do I put my number?</h4>
		<p>
			On the front number plate.
		</p>

		<h4>Where do I put my transponder?</h4>
		<p>
			On the back of the front number plate.

		<h4>Will this interfere with other series that use transponders?</h4>
		<p>
			It does interfere, but we override the signal. It’s best for results if you don’t have another transponder on your body or bike.
